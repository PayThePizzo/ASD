# Algoritmi e Strutture Dati
Note del corso, per la versione inglese curata da @PayThePizzo [premere qui](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms)

This repository follows the content of "Algorithms and Data Structures" 
[Mod. 1](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339889) and 
[Mod. 2](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339890) for the 
[Bachelor of Computer Science](https://www.unive.it/pag/3/) at
[Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/).

However, there will be some content that is added by myself for a better understanding of the main data
structures used in Tech nowadays.
This is a project that will be, eventually, extended to implement more information about the subject in a second time.

## Data Structures
We **do not include** some basic data structure that must be covered in an introductory course such as:
* Sets
* Arrays
* Stack
* Queues
* Linked Lists and their declinations

## Algorithms
We will try implement most of the algorithms in order to make them runnable.

We cover:
* Time Complexity
* Recursion resolution 
* The basic operations for the main data structures
* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Theory

## Compilation

### C
TBD

### C++
TBD

### Credits
All credits for the content go to:
* Professor [Alessandra Raffaeta'](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/5591966) and [Marcello Pelillo](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/5592849)
* [DFI] C. Demetrescu, I. Finocchi, G.F. Italiano. Algoritmi e strutture dati. Seconda Edizione. McGraw-Hill, 2008.
* [CLRS] T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, C. Stein. Introduction to algorithms 3/ed. McGraw-Hill, 2010.
* Computer Science Bachelor Students at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

We add specific credits to each markdown file in case we get some more external information.
We highly recommend buying these books.

### Final Message
As students, we think knowledge and culture should be accessible to anyone interested. Furthermore,
education should be free. This is why we will try to structure these notes as well as possible, so if you notice any 
mistake at any level, please feel free to contact us about it.
